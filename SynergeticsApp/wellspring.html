<H1>Introduction: The Wellspring of Reality  </H1>

<P>     We are in an age that assumes the narrowing trends of specialization to be logical,
natural, and desirable. Consequently, society expects all earnestly responsible
communication to be crisply brief. Advancing science has now discovered that all the
known cases of biological extinction have been caused by overspecialization, whose
concentration of only selected genes sacrifices general adaptability. Thus the specialist's
brief for pinpointing brevity is dubious. In the meantime, humanity has been deprived of
comprehensive understanding. Specialization has bred feelings of isolation, futility, and
confusion in individuals. It has also resulted in the individual's leaving responsibility for
thinking and social action to others. Specialization breeds biases that ultimately aggregate
as international and ideological discord, which, in turn, leads to war.</P>
<P>     We are not seeking a license to ramble wordily. We are intent only upon being
adequately concise. General systems science discloses the existence of minimum sets of
variable factors that uniquely govern each and every system. Lack of knowledge
concerning all the factors and the failure to include them in our integral imposes false
conclusions. Let us not make the error of inadequacy in examining our most
comprehensive inventory of experience and thoughts regarding the evoluting affairs of all
humanity.
</P>

<P>     There is an inherently minimum set of essential concepts and current information,
cognizance of which could lead to our operating our planet Earth to the lasting
satisfaction and health of all humanity. With this objective, we set out on our review of the
spectrum of significant experiences and seek therein for the greatest meanings as well as
for the family of generalized principles governing the realization of their optimum
significance to humanity aboard our Sun circling planet Earth.</P>
<P>     We must start with scientific fundamentals, and that means with the data of
experiments and not with assumed axioms predicated only upon the misleading nature of
that which only superficially seems to be obvious. It is the consensus of great scientists
that science is the attempt to set in order the facts of experience. Holding within their
definition, we define Universe as the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended
and communicated, nonsimultaneous, and only partially overlapping experiences. An
aggregate of finites is finite. Universe is a finite but nonsimultaneously conceptual
scenario.</P>
<P>     The human brain is a physical mechanism for storing, retrieving, and re-storing again,
each special-case experience. The experience is often a packaged concept. Such packages
consist of complexedly interrelated and not as-yet differentially analyzed phenomena
which, as initially unit cognitions, are potentially re-experienceable. A rose, for instance,
grows. has thorns, blossoms, and fragrance, but often is stored in the brain only under the
single word-rose.</P>
<P>     As Korzybski, the founder of general semantics, pointed out, the consequence of its
single-tagging is that the rose becomes reflexively considered by man only as a red, white,
or pink device for paying tribute to a beautiful girl, a thoughtful hostess, or last night's
deceased acquaintance. The tagging of the complex biological process under the single
title rose tends to detour human curiosity from further differentiation of its integral
organic operations as well as from consideration of its interecological functionings aboard
our planet. We don't know what a rose is, nor what may be its essential and unique
cosmic function. Thus for long have we inadvertently deferred potential discovery of the
essential roles in Universe that are performed complementarily by many, if not most, of the
phenomena we experience. But, goaded by youth, we older ones are now taking second
looks at almost everything. And that promises many ultimately favorable surprises. The
oldsters do have vast experience banks not available to the youth. Their memory banks,
integrated and reviewed, may readily disclose generalized principles of eminent
importance.</P>
<P>     The word generalization in literature usually means covering too much territory too
thinly to be persuasive, let alone convincing. In science, however, a generalization means a
principle that has been found to hold true in every special case.</P>
<P>     The principle of leverage is a scientific generalization. It makes no difference of what
material either the fulcrum or the lever consists-wood, steel, or reinforced concrete. Nor
do the special-case sizes of the lever and fulcrum, or of the load pried at one end, or the
work applied at the lever's other end in any way alter either the principle or the
mathematical regularity of the ratios of physical work advantage that are provided at
progressive fulcrum-to-load increments of distance outward from the fulcrum in the
opposite direction along the lever's arm at which the operating effort is applied.
</P>
<P>     Mind is the weightless and uniquely human faculty that surveys the ever larger
inventory of special-case experiences stored in the brain bank and, seeking to identify their
intercomplementary significance, from time to time discovers one of the rare scientifically
generalizable principles running consistently through all the relevant experience set. The
thoughts that discover these principles are weightless and tentative and may also be
eternal. They suggest eternity but do not prove it, even though there have been no
experiences thus far that imply exceptions to their persistence. It seems also to follow that
the more experiences we have, the more chances there are that the mind may discover, on
the one hand, additional generalized principles or, on the other hand, exceptions that
disqualify one or another of the already catalogued principles that, having heretofore held
"true" without contradiction for a long time, had been tentatively conceded to be
demonstrating eternal persistence of behavior.  Mind's relentless reviewing of the
comprehensive brain bank's storage of all our special-case experiences tends both to
progressive enlargement and definitive refinement of the catalogue of generalized
principles that interaccommodatively govern all transactions of Universe.</P>
<P>     It follows that the more specialized society becomes, the less attention does it pay to
the discoveries of the mind, which are intuitively beamed toward the brain, there to be
received only if the switches are "on." Specialization tends to shut off the wide-band
tuning searches and thus to preclude further discovery of the all-powerful generalized
principles. Again we see how society's perverse fixation on specialization leads to its
extinction. We are so specialized that one man discovers empirically how to release the
energy of the atom, while another, unbeknownst to him, is ordered by his political
factotum to make an atomic bomb by use of the secretly and anonymously published data.
That gives much expedient employment, which solves the politician's momentary problem,
but requires that the politicians keep on preparing for further warring with other political
states to keep their respective peoples employed. It is also mistakenly assumed that
employment is the only means by which humans can earn the right to live, for politicians
have yet to discover how much wealth is available for distribution. All this is rationalized
on the now scientifically discredited premise that there can never be enough life support
for all. Thus humanity's specialization leads only toward warring and such devastating
tools, both, visible and invisible, as ultimately to destroy all Earthians.</P>
<P>     Only a comprehensive switch from the narrowing specialization and toward an ever
more inclusive and refining comprehension by all humanity-regarding all the factors
governing omnicontinuing life aboard our spaceship Earth-can bring about reorientation
from the self-extinction-bound human trending, and do so within the critical time
remaining before we have passed the point of chemical process irretrievability.
<P>     Quite clearly, our task is predominantly metaphysical, for it is how to get all of
humanity to educate itself swiftly enough to generate spontaneous social behaviors that
will avoid extinction.</P>
<P>     Living upon the threshold between yesterday and tomorrow, which threshold we
reflexively assumed in some long ago yesterday to constitute an eternal now, we are aware
of the daily-occurring, vast multiplication of experience generated information by which
we potentially may improve our understanding of our yesterdays' experiences and
therefrom derive our most farsighted preparedness for successive tomorrows.</P>
<P>     Anticipating, cooperating with, and employing the forces of nature can be
accomplished only by the mind. The wisdom manifest in the omni-interorderliness of the
family of generalized principles operative in Universe can be employed only by the highest
integrity of engagement of the mind's metaphysical intuiting and formulating capabilities.
</P>
<P>     We are able to assert that this rationally coordinating system bridge has been
established between science and the humanities because we have made adequate
experimental testing of it in a computerized world-resource-use-exploration system, which
by virtue of the proper inclusion of all the parameters-as guaranteed by the synergetic start
with Universe and the progressive differentiation out of all the parts-has demonstrated a
number of alternate ways in which it is eminently feasible not only to provide full life
support for all humans but also to permit all humans' individual enjoyment of all the Earth
without anyone profiting at the expense of another and without any individuals interfering
with others.</P>
<P>     While it takes but meager search to discover that many well-known concepts are false,
it takes considerable search and even more careful examination of one's own personal
experiences and inadvertently spontaneous reflexing to discover that there are many
popularly and even professionally unknown, yet nonetheless fundamental, concepts to hold
true in all cases and that already have been discovered by other as yet obscure individuals.
That is to say that many scientific generalizations have been discovered but have not come
to the attention of what we call the educated world at large, thereafter to be incorporated
tardily within the formal education processes, and even more tardily, in the ongoing
political-economic affairs of everyday life. Knowledge of the existence and comprehensive
significance of these as yet popularly unrecognized natural laws often is requisite to the
solution of many of the as yet unsolved problems now confronting society. Lack of
knowledge of the solution's existence often leaves humanity confounded when it need not
be.</P>
<P>     Intellectually advantaged with no more than the child's facile, lucid eagerness to
understand constructively and usefully the major transformational events of our own
times, it probably is synergetically advantageous to review swiftly the most comprehensive
inventory of the most powerful human environment transforming events of our totally
known and reasonably extended history. This is especially useful in winnowing out and
understanding the most significant of the metaphysical revolutions now recognized as
swiftly tending to reconstitute history. By such a comprehensively schematic review, we
might identify also the unprecedented and possibly heretofore overlooked pivotal
revolutionary events not only of today but also of those trending to be central to
tomorrow's most cataclysmic changes.</P>
<P>     It is synergetically reasonable to assume that relativistic evaluation of any of the
separate drives of art, science, education, economics, and ideology, and their complexedly
interacting trends within our own times, may be had only through the most comprehensive
historical sweep of which we are capable.</P>
<P>     There could be produced a synergetic understanding of humanity's cosmic functioning,
which, until now, had been both undiscovered and unpredictable due to our deliberate and
exclusive preoccupation only with the separate statistics of separate events. As a typical
consequence of the latter, we observe our society's persistent increase of educational and
employment specialization despite the already mentioned, well-documented scientific
disclosure that the extinctions of biological species are always occasioned by
overspecialization. Specialization's preoccupation with parts deliberately forfeits the
opportunity to apprehend and comprehend what is provided exclusively by synergy.</P>
<P>     Today's news consists of aggregates of fragments. Anyone who has taken part in any
event that has subsequently appeared in the news is aware of the gross disparity between
the actual and the reported events. The insistence by reporters upon having advance
"releases" of what, for instance, convocation speakers are supposedly going to say but in
fact have not yet said, automatically discredits the value of the largely prefabricated news.
We also learn frequently of prefabricated and prevaricated events of a complex nature
purportedly undertaken for purposes either of suppressing or rigging the news, which in
turn perverts humanity's tactical information resources. All history becomes suspect.
Probably our most polluted resource is the tactical information to which humanity
spontaneously reflexes.</P>
<P>     Furthermore, today's hyperspecialization in socioeconomic functioning has come to
preclude important popular philosophic considerations of the synergetic significance of,
for instance, such historically important events as the discovery within the general region
of experimental inquiry known as virology that the as-yet popularly assumed validity of
the concepts of animate and inanimate phenomena have been experimentally invalidated.
Atoms and crystal complexes of atoms were held to be obviously inanimate; the
protoplasmic cells of biological phenomena were held to be obviously animate. It was
deemed to be common sense that warm-blooded, moist, and soft-skinned humans were
clearly not to be confused with hard, cold granite or steel objects. A clear-cut threshold
between animate and inanimate was therefore assumed to exist as a fundamental
dichotomy of all physical phenomena. This seemingly placed life exclusively within the
bounds of the physical.</P>
<P>     The supposed location of the threshold between animate and inanimate was
methodically narrowed down by experimental science until it was confined specifically
within the domain of virology. Virologists have been too busy, for instance, with their
DNA-RNA genetic code isolatings, to find time to see the synergetic significance to
society of the fact that they have found that no physical threshold does in fact exist
between animate and inanimate. The possibility of its existence vanished because the
supposedly unique physical qualities of both animate and inanimate have persisted right
across yesterday's supposed threshold in both directions to permeate one
another's-previously perceived to be exclusive-domains. Subsequently, what was animate
has become foggier and foggier, and what is inanimate clearer and clearer. All organisms
consist physically and in entirety of inherently inanimate atoms. The inanimate alone is not
only omnipresent but is alone experimentally demonstrable. Belated news of the
elimination of this threshold must be interpreted to mean that whatever life may be, it has
not been isolated and thereby identified as residual in the biological cell, as had been
supposed by the false assumption that there was a separate physical phenomenon called
animate within which life existed.  No life per se has been isolated. The threshold between
animate and inanimate has vanished. Those chemists who are preoccupied in synthesizing
the particular atomically structured molecules identified as the prime constituents of
humanly employed organisms will, even if they are chemically successful, be as remote
from creating life as are automobile manufacturers from creating the human drivers of
their automobiles. Only the physical connections and development complexes of distinctly
"nonlife" atoms into molecules, into cells, into animals, has been and will be discovered.
The genetic coding of the design controls of organic systems offers no more explanation
of life than did the specifications of the designs of the telephone system's apparatus and
operation explain the nature of the life that communicates weightlessly to life over the
only physically ponderable telephone system. Whatever else life may be, we know it is
weightless. At the moment of death, no weight is lost. All the chemicals, including the
chemist's life ingredients, are present, but life has vanished. The physical is inherently
entropic, giving off energy in ever more disorderly ways.  The metaphysical is
antientropic, methodically marshalling energy. Life is antientropic. It is spontaneously
inquisitive. It sorts out and endeavors to understand.</P>
<P>     The overconcentration on details of hyperspecialization has also been responsible for
the lack of recognition by science of its inherently mandatory responsibility to reorient all
our educational curricula because of the synergetically disclosed, but popularly
uncomprehended, significance of the 1956 Nobel Prize-winning discovery in physics of the
experimental invalidation of the concept of "parity" by which science previously had
misassumed that positive-negative complementations consisted exclusively of
mirror-imaged behaviors of physical phenomena.</P>
<P>     Science's self-assumed responsibility has been self-limited to disclosure to society only
of the separate, supposedly physical (because separately weighable) atomic component
isolations data. Synergetic integrity would require the scientists to announce that in reality
what had been identified heretofore as physical is entirely metaphysical-because
synergetically weightless. Metaphysical has been science's designation for all weightless
phenomena such as thought. But science has made no experimental finding of any
phenomena that can be described as a solid, or as continuous, or as a straight surface
plane, or as a straight line, or as infinite anything. We are now synergetically forced to
conclude that all phenomena are metaphysical; wherefore, as many have long
suspected-like it or not-life is but a dream.</P>
<P>     Science has found no up or down directions of Universe, yet scientists are personally so
ill-coordinated that they all still personally and sensorially see "solids" going up or
down-as, for instance, they see the Sun "going down."  Sensorially disconnected from
their theoretically evolved information, scientists discern no need on their part to suggest
any educational reforms to correct the misconceiving that science has tolerated for half a
millennium.</P>
<P>     Society depends upon its scientists for just such educational reform guidance. Where
else might society turn for advice?  Unguided by science, society is allowed to go right on
filling its childrens' brain banks with large inventories of competence-devastating
misinformation. In order to emerge from its massive ignorance, society will probably have
to rely exclusively upon its individuals' own minds to survey the pertinent experimental
data-as do all great scientist-artists. This, in effect, is what the intuition of world-around
youth is beginning to do. Mind can see that reality is evoluting into weightless
metaphysics. The wellspring of reality is the family of weightless generalized principles.</P>
<P>     It is essential to release humanity from the false fixations of yesterday, which seem now
to bind it to a rationale of action leading only to extinction.</P>
<P>     The youth of humanity all around our planet are intuitively revolting from all
sovereignties and political ideologies. The youth of Earth are moving intuitively toward an
utterly classless, raceless, omnicooperative, omniworld humanity. Children freed of the
ignorantly founded educational traditions and exposed only to their spontaneously
summoned, computer-stored and -distributed outflow of reliable-opinion-purged,
experimentally verified data, shall indeed lead society to its happy egress from all
misinformedly conceived, fearfully and legally imposed, and physically enforced customs
of yesterday. They can lead all humanity into omnisuccessful survival as well as entrance
into an utterly new era of human experience in an as-yet and ever-will-be fundamentally
mysterious Universe.</P>
<P>     And whence will come the wealth with which we may undertake to lead world man into
his new and validly hopeful life? From the wealth of the minds of world man-whence
comes all wealth. Only mind can discover how to do so much with so little as forever to be
able to sustain and physically satisfy all humanity.
