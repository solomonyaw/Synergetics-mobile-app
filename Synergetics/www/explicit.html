  <H1>Explicit: A note to the reader</H1>


<P>Synergetics 1 and Synergetics 2 are separate volumes only because of their bulk and
the chronology of their composition. They in fact comprise a single integral work. Each
chapter in the first volume has been expanded in the second, and the sequence of
paragraphs has been numbered to dovetail and provide a shared context.
</P>
<P>It is the essence of synergy to produce unpredicted-indeed, unpredictable-results like
the surprise geometrical discoveries of this second volume. Synergetics 2 continues the
exposition of Fuller's radical geometrical cosmos with its landscapes of unfamiliar models
and metaphors; it amplifies and amends-but does not supersede-the earlier volume
published in 1975; it makes more explicit the significance of certain geometrical functions
that are only implicit in Synergetics 1; and it introduces the term epistemography to
describe Fuller's geometry of thinking. The two books together present descriptions that
are explicit as well as contextual.
</P>
<P>Buckminster Fuller employs the discipline of a lecturer, recommencing his expositions
from the beginning, reviewing the previous experiments and recalls of experiences. His
written discourse, like his speech, is replete with sustained narrative sequences that
recapitulate the geometrical premises, ever starting back from the beginning . . . as Fuller
says, like the pole vaulter who always goes back to the end of the cinder track before
repeating his sprint.
</P>
<P> Although the apparatus of section numbers is handy as a key to context and essential
for indexing and for cross-reference, it tends to obscure the logical continuity of certain
passages that merit the reader's sustained attention. For this reason the Table of Contents
is supplemented with a Table of Scenarios. The new reader seeking an avenue into the
work should choose from the list of Scenarios as a guide; those seeking a specific topic
may refer to the Table of Contents.
</P>
<P> The index and cross-references in Synergetics 2 refer to both volumes; references to
Synergetics 1 are in roman numbers and those in Synergetics 2 in italic numerals.
