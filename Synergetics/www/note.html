   <H1>Author's Note on the Rationale for Repetition in This Work</H1>

<P>     It is the writer's experience that new degrees of comprehension are always and only
consequent to ever-renewed review of the spontaneously rearranged inventory of
significant factors. This awareness of the processes leading to new degrees of
comprehension spontaneously motivates the writer to describe over and over again
what-to the careless listener or reader-might seem to be tiresome repetition, but to the
successful explorer is known to be essential mustering of operational strategies from
which alone new thrusts of comprehension can be successfully accomplished.
</P>
<P>     To the careless reader seeking only entertainment the repetition will bring about swift
disconnect. Those experienced with the writer and motivated by personal experience with
mental discoveries-co-experiencing comprehensive breakthroughs with the writer-are not
dismayed by the seeming necessity to start all over again inventorying the now seemingly
most lucidly relevant.
</P>
<P>     Universe factors intuitively integrating to attain new perspective and effectively
demonstrated logic of new degrees of comprehension that's the point. I have not forgotten
that I have talked about these things before. It is part of the personal discipline, no matter
how formidable the re-inventorying may seem, to commit myself to that task when
inspired by intuitive glimpses of important new relationships-inspired overpoweringly
because of the realized human potential of progressive escape from ignorance.
